All hydrabus-only code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 as is the rest of HydraBus.
Libfrser is under GPLv3 for the purposes of this integration with HydraBus.

To get rid of GPLv3 influence: HYDRAFW_FRSER = 0 in the main Makefile, and then the
libfrser submodule does not even need to be checked out.
